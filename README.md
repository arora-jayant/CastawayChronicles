# CastawayChronicles
At Castaway Chronicles, our aim is to cater to a diverse group of learners, including the visually impaired, students with ADHD and special-education students.

This project is dedicated to designing an adventurous game with educational aspects that ensures a fun, enriching experience for children and students. At Castaway Chronicles, our aim is to cater to a diverse group of learners, including the visually impaired, students with ADHD and special-education students. Students with special learning needs and attention-deficit disorders often struggle to stay engaged in their learning and thereby require more creative teaching techniques that are thoughtfully designed to accommodate their learning styles, empowering and encouraging them to thrive in their educational journey. Through the completion of mini-games and challenges, centered around educational and recreational games, kids will be driven to learn on their own with Castaway Chronicles. This will allow them to win the game and collect coins. With this approach, the team at Castaway Chronicles aspires to make a meaningful impact in the lives of children that face difficulties in mastering foundational skills.
